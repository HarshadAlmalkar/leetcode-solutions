## 📌 Problem Details

### 🔹 Day 1: Two Sum

- **Problem Name**: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- **Difficulty**: Easy  
- **Topic**: Arrays, Hash Table

#### 🚀 Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

> You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

#### 🧠 Example:
```

Input: nums = \[2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: \[0, 1]
Explanation: nums\[0] + nums\[1] = 2 + 7 = 9

```

---

## 🔍 My Approach:

- Loop through the array using `enumerate()`
- Use a hash map (`lookup`) to store previously seen numbers
- For each number, check if `(target - number)` exists in the map
- If yes, return their indices
